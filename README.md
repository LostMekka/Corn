Story
-
Trump has been elected for president and transformed the world into a post-apocalyptic zombie-filled wasteland. 
Democracy ceased to exist as the only ones who have the right to vote are appointed by his circle of party leaders. 
This circle is of course mind-controlled by Trump himself.

You play a unicorn, whose existence is threatened by recently passed racist anti-unicorn laws. 
With your back to the wall (built by mexicans) you decide to retaliate. 
Can you prevail against the mindless hordes of voters, bodyguards and lawyers? 
Will you triumph against the mighty **zombie president LeTrump**, or will you die horribly trying? 

~~Can you build a civilization, that can stand the test of time?~~ (Whoops, wrong game)
